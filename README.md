# mycroft-skill-fox-news
A skill for MycroftAI that plays the latest fox news.

## DESCRIPTION:

This Mycroft skill is a modification of the npr-skill by jdorleans.
Basically, all I have done is changed the URL from the latest NPR
news feed to Fox News Radio's latest news feed.

## CURRENT STATE:

Works great!

## USAGE:

Say any phrase that contains "fox news."  For instance, any of the
following will work:

  * "Mycroft, fox news please"
  * "Mycroft, tell me fox news"
  * "Mycroft, I want to listen to fox news"
  * "Mycroft, play fox news"

## ISSUES / TODO:

Nothing that I can think of.
